# Baby Name App
### Work in progress

This app will help expecting parents brainstorm baby names by giving them
access to 2000 of the most popular names to choose from. I built a web scraper
to collect and organize the names and created an API endpoint using flask_restful.
It will include a frontend that pulls names based on gender and letter.
