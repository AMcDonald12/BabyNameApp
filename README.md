# Baby Name App

This app will help expecting parents brainstorm baby names by giving them
access to 2000 of the most popular names to choose from. I built a web scraper
to collect and organize the names and created an API endpoint using flask_restful.
The app is built on .NET Maui, and utilizes the API to bring the user random baby names
